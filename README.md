## 📘 Day 19: Interfaces | HackerRank 30 Days of Code  

This repository contains the Python solution for Day 19 of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, focusing on the concept of Interfaces and class-based implementation.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

-You are required to define an interface AdvancedArithmetic with a method divisorSum(n).

-Then, implement a class Calculator that:

-Inherits from AdvancedArithmetic

-Implements the divisorSum method to return the sum of all divisors of a given number n.

## 📝 Problem Statement

-Complete the Calculator class by:

-Creating a method divisorSum(n) that:

-Finds all positive divisors of n

-Returns the sum of those divisors

-The program should also print:

-I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic

-Followed by the sum returned from the method

## ✅ Constraints

      1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

## 🔢 Sample Input

      6

## ✅ Sample Output

      I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
      12

## 💡 Explanation

-The positive divisors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3, 6

-Their sum is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12

-The program also dynamically prints the name of the base class/interface implemented using:
type(my_calculator).__bases__[0].__name__

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

-Interfaces / Abstract Classes

-Class Inheritance

-Method Overriding

-Reflection in Python

-Clean and modular OOP-based design

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named input.txt with the required input and run:

      python3 interfaces.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input

Just run:

      python3 interfaces.py
